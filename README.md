Hi, I'm Saanidhya

My interests lie in Neural Networks and Finance, and I happen to find Machine Language very fascinating.

I'm currently learning Rust, and trying to dip my toes in Machine Learning.

Feel free to reach out at saanidhyaaryasingh@gmail.com.

Fun fact- I'm crazy obsessed with cats, race cars and classic literature. The order is yet to be decided.
